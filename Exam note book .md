For this project, we attempted to forecast the weight of a person using their age, height, and level of exercise. We used a dataset from Kaggle called "Health and Lifestyle Dataset" and a Linear Regression model to perform predictions. After cleaning the data and converting the exercise column into values, we trained the model and tested it using Mean Squared Error. The result showed that the model was able to forecast weight fairly well, considering the restricted features. However, the inclusion of additional information like gender, diet, or medical history would make it better for prediction. Overall, this project illustrated the way in which simple health data can be used to design a simple weight forecasting model and can be improved through more complex techniques and more features.

"""# üìò Weight Prediction Using Linear Regression

## üìä Dataset
- **Source**: Health and Lifestyle Dataset (Kaggle)
- **Features Used**: Age, Height, Exercise

## üéØ Objective
Predict an individual's weight using simple physiological and lifestyle features.

## üîç Approach
- Data cleaned and categorical variable encoded
- Trained a Linear Regression model on 80% of the data
- Evaluated using Mean Squared Error

## üìà Results
- The model showed reasonable prediction ability with an MSE of around [printed value]
- Visual inspection via scatter plot confirms linear relationship assumptions

## ‚úÖ Conclusion
This is a strong baseline. Adding non-linear features or using ensemble models may improve results.
